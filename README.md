The CSIT Notes is a final-year project developed as part of a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Information Technology (BScCSIT) program. This web-based platform serves as a recommendation system tailored to the unique needs of CSIT (Computer Science and Information Technology) students. The core recommendation mechanism relies on the collaborative filtering technique, employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient algorithm to enhance the user experience. Our project is created using Django for backend development, PostgreSQL for database management, and Bootstrap for frontend design. It provides an intuitive and visually appealing platform for CSIT students to access personalized study material recommendations through a responsive and user-friendly interface.

In the CSIT Notes, our recommendation system is the backbone of personalized user experiences, driven by collaborative filtering and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient algorithm. This algorithm operates by examining the historical actions of each user based on the study materials they have rated on a scale of 1 star to 5 stars. It then calculates the Pearson correlation coefficients between users based on their shared preferences and behavior patterns. These coefficients represent the similarity between users' study habits, with values closer to 1 indicating strong similarity and -1 indicating dissimilarity. By utilizing these correlation coefficients, the system generates tailored recommendations for each user. For instance, if User A demonstrates a high correlation with User B and User B has positively interacted with specific study materials, the system suggests those materials to User A. Moreover, the recommendation engine adapts as users continue to interact with the platform, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant and aligned with evolving preferences. This data-driven approach not only enhances the discoverability of study materials but also fosters a dynamic and personalized learning environment within the CSIT Notes.

We tested numerous collaborative filtering techniques, including Cosine Similarity and Matrix Factorization, coupled with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm in our research for the CSIT Notes employing datasets of aroundÂ 4000 users. Our results repeatedly indicated that PCC was the better option. It not only outperformed the competition but also demonstrated astounding resilience when dealing with limited data. The success of the project was greatly enhanced by PCC's capacity to record both positive and negative user preferences, which resulted in more exact and customized study material recommendations. These empirical findings strengthened our trust that PCC is the best algorithm for suggesting tailored studies through the CSIT Notes.
